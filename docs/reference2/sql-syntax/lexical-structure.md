## Identifiers

- Identifiers = user-space symbols
- Identify streams, tables, and other objects created by the user
  - examples: I create a stream called `s1`. `s1` is an identifier
- case insensitive

[ example ]

TODO: what makes a valid identifier?

- Backticked identifiers = escaped for exact casing
- Allows you to use any name of your choosing, including keywords.
- This is useful if you don't control the data

[ example ]

## Constants

- A value of a given type - a literal
- String constants - single quotes
- Numeric constants
- Boolean constants

## Operators

The following table lists all of the operators that are supported by ksqlDB SQL.

| operator     | meaning                        | applies to      
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------
| `=`          | is equal to                    | string, numeric 
| `!=` or `<>` | is not equal to                | string, numeric 
| `<`          | is less than                   | string, numeric         
| `<=`         | is less than or equal to       | string, numeric         
| `>`          | is greater than                | string, numeric         
| `>=`         | is greater than or equal to    | string, numeric         
| `+`          | addition for numeric, concatenation for string | string, numeric         
| `-`          | subtraction                    | numeric         
| `*`          | multiplication                 | numeric         
| `/`          | division                       | numeric         
| `%`          | modulus                        | numeric 
| `||` or `+`  | concatenation                  | string          
| `:=`         | assignment                     | all             
| `->`         | struct field dereference       | struct     
| `.`          | source dereference             | table, stream
| `E` or `e`   | exponent                       | numeric
| `NOT`        | logical NOT                    | boolean
| `AND`        | logical AND                    | boolean
| `OR`         | logical OR                     | boolean
| `BETWEEN`    | test if value within range     | numeric, string
| `LIKE`       | match a pattern                | string

The explanation for each operator includes a supporting example based on
the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE USERS (
    USERID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    FIRST_NAME STRING,
    LAST_NAME STRING,
    NICKNAMES ARRAY<STRING>,
    ADDRESS STRUCT<STREET_NAME STRING, HOUSE_NUM INTEGER>
) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='users', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');
```

### Arithmetic

You can apply the familiar arithmetic operators, like `+` and `%`, to
[numeric types](data-types/numeric.md), like INT, BIGINT, DOUBLE, and
DECIMAL.

The following example statement uses the addition operator (`+`) to compute
the sum of the lengths of two strings:

```sql
SELECT USERID, LEN(FIRST_NAME) + LEN(LAST_NAME) AS NAME_LENGTH FROM USERS EMIT CHANGES;
```

### Concatenation

Use the concatenation operator (`+` or `||`) to concatenate
[STRING](data-types/character.md) values.

```sql
SELECT USERID, FIRST_NAME + LAST_NAME AS FULL_NAME FROM USERS EMIT CHANGES;
```

You can use the concatenation operator for multi-part concatenation.

The following example statement uses the concatenation operator to create
an error message:

```sql
SELECT USERID,
    TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss') +
        ': :heavy_exclamation_mark: On ' +
        HOST +
        ' there were ' +
        CAST(INVALID_LOGIN_COUNT AS VARCHAR) +
        ' attempts in the last minute (threshold is >=4)'
  FROM INVALID_USERS_LOGINS_PER_HOST
  WHERE INVALID_LOGIN_COUNT>=4
  EMIT CHANGES;
```

### Source dereference

Use the source dereference operator (`.`) to specify columns by dereferencing
the source stream or table.

Providing the fully qualified column name is optional, unless the column name is
ambiguous. For example, if two sides of a join both contain a `foo` column, any
reference to `foo` in the query must be fully qualified.

The following example statement selects the values of the USERID and FIRST_NAME
columns in the USERS table by using the fully qualified column names:

```sql
SELECT USERS.USERID, USERS.FIRST_NAME FROM USERS EMIT CHANGES;
```

### Subscript

Use the subscript operator (`[subscript_expr]`) to reference the value at an
[array](data-types/compound.md#array) index or a [array](data-types/compound.md#map)
map key. Arrays indexes are one-based.

The following example statement selects the first string in the NICKNAMES array:

```sql
SELECT USERID, NICKNAMES[1] FROM USERS EMIT CHANGES;
```

### STRUCT dereference

Access nested data by declaring a STRUCT and using the dereference operator
(`->`) to access its fields.

The following example statement selects the values of the STREET and HOUSE_NUM
fields in the ADDRESS struct: 

```sql
SELECT USERID, ADDRESS->STREET, ADDRESS->HOUSE_NUM FROM USERS EMIT CHANGES;
```

Combine `->` with `.` to provide fully qualified names:

```sql
SELECT USERID, USERS.ADDRESS->STREET, U.ADDRESS->STREET FROM USERS U EMIT CHANGES;
```



## Special characters

Not a function/operator/identifier, have meta-meaning for the commands.

- Parens
- brackets
- commas
- semi-colon
- colon
- asterisk
- dot

## Comments

- -- double dash

TODO: does ksqlDB have multi-line comments?

There are bracketed comments in the grammar, so I think so.
'/*' .*? '*/' 

## Operator precedence

Precedence in order:

1. `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus)
2. `+` (positive), - (negative), + (addition), + (concatenation), - (subtraction)
3. `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, `!=` (comparison operators)
4. NOT
5. AND
6. BETWEEN, LIKE, OR

In an expression, when two operators have the same precedence level, they're
evaluated left-to-right based on their position in the expression.

You can enclose an expression in parentheses to force precedence or clarify
precedence, for example, _(5 + 2) * 3_.
